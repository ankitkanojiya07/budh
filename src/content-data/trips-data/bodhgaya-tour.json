  "destination": "Delhi- Patna - Bodhgaya - Varanasi- Lucknow - Delhi",
  "duration": "10 Days",
  "mainDesc": "Bodhgaya: in the state of Bihar, reckoned as the most important Buddhist pilgrimage center, is the place where Lord Sakyamuni (Gautam Buddha) entered into mediation after being moved by the sufferings of mankind. The giant Bodhi Tree (Peepal) that we see today is believed to have grown from the original Bodhi Tree under which, sitting on the raised platform, Prince Siddharth mediated and finally attained Nirvana. Monasteries raised here by Burmese, Tibetan, Chinese, Japanese and Thai devotees, in their native architectural styles, are worth visiting. Then there is Chaukramana, the Jewel Walk, where it is believed that the Buddha strolled while in deep thought.",
  "para": [
    "The magnificent Maha Bodhi temple in Bodhgaya is an architectural amalgamation of many cultures. The temple bears the stamp of the architecture of the Gupta Dynasty and subsequent ages. On the walls of the temple, one sees Buddha carved in different aspects, and in the sanctum sanctorum, a colossal Buddha, is seen touching the ground, which has mythological significance in the Buddhist lores. The temple carries inscriptions recording the visits of pilgrims from Sri Lanka, China and Mayanmar. In the 7th and 10th Centuries AD Hieun Tsang, the Chinese traveler, also visited the temple in the 7th Century. Finally a visit to the Bodhgaya Archaeological Museum is a must for a religious art lover as it initiates one into the age of Buddha's centered art forms. The Buddhist sculpture collection from 1st Century BC to 11th Century AD is housed here at one place.Reflected through several art forms, it is more like a treasure house of artistic expression.",
    "Bodhgaya is 245 kms. from Varanasi and 178 kms. from Patna via Rajgir and Nalanda. A place of religious sanctity for Hindus, Gaya lies 12 kms. from Bodhgaya between Pretshila and Ramshila hills and is washed by the shores of river Phalgu. Gaya has a large number of Buddhist temples also. While Buddha was doing severe penance, he became weak, tired and hungry. He rested under a tree, where he was offered food by a condemned village woman named Sujata. To everybody's surprise Buddha accepted her offerings. Legend has it that after having consumed the food, Buddha's countenance assumed a divine glow and he realized the Supreme Truth; that neither extreme self indulgence nor self mortification is ever required. What is needed is to follow the Middle Path (Department of tourism). Sujata Sthan or Durgeshwari Temple stands as a symbol commemorating this event."

Under the tree is the Vajrasan, the platform on which Siddhartha had sat in meditation. Close to Vajrasan is Buddhapada, the footprints of the Buddha on stone and Chaukramana, the Jewel Walk, where it is believed that the Buddha strolled while in deep thought. Many sacred trees in India and other countries are originally raised from seeds brought from the ancient Bodh Gaya tree. Bhikkhuni Sanghamitra, daughter of the Indian emperor, Ashoka had taken a shoot of the original Bodhi tree to Sri Lanka in the 3rd century BCE, where it was planted by the Sri Lankan ruler, Devanampiya Tissa at the Mahavira monastery in Anuradhapura, and is still a sacred place for the Buddhists"
