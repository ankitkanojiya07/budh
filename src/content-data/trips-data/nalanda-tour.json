Established by the Gupta kings, Nalanda was an important university that attracted Buddhist students from all over the world. Scholars like Huen Tsang and Fahien were products of the Nalanda University.",
  "para": [
    "Ancient records indicate that Nalanda was frequented very often by Lord Mahavira and Lord Buddha during the 5th and 6th centuries quite regularly. Nalanda University ruins carpet around 14 acres of land in present-day Nalanda, a tiny village that still recounts its lost glory. Nalanda ruins represent interesting instances of Kushana architectural traditions.",
    "The Nava Nalanda Mahavihar and the Nalanda Museum qualify as must-visits for those on Nalanda travel tours. Tour the Surya Temple at Baragaon located on the outskirts of Nalanda. Located at a distance of 72 kilometers from Patna, the capital of Bihar, Nalanda serves as the ideal base for those traveling to Rajgir, Bodh Gaya, and Bihar Sharief."
