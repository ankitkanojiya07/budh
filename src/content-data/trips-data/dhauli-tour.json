  "mainDesc": "Dating from 260 BC the Dhauli edicts give detailed instructions to Ashoka's administrators to rule his subjects with gentleness and fairness. Driving down the Puri-Konark Highway from Bhubaneshwar one comes across Dhauli hill on the banks of the River Daya. Surrounded by the soothing greenery of paddy fields, lies the 3rd Century BC Ashokan Rock Edict, a memory of the gruesome war that transformed Ashoka, the great warrior into a Buddhist missionary. The Peace Pagoda built in collaboration with the Kalinga-Japanese Buddhist Sangha, on the opposite hill, is completely modern and is an excellent foil.",
