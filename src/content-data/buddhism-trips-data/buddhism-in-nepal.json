    "Buddha was born some 2500 years ago in Lumbini in the southern Nepal.Lumbini is the greatest pilgrimage site for all the Buddhists from all over the world.Lumbini today houses the pond where Buddha was bathed after he was born and a temple which has images of young Buddha with his mother.There is also a Stone pillar which is one of such many pillars put by the famous Indian emperor Ashoka to mark the important sites related to Buddha's life. In an excavation made few years ago more objects of historical importance were discovered which are in display for all. Besides there are many stupas in Lumbini made by many Buddhist countries of the worldâ€”Thailand, China, Sri Lanka, Japan and Myanmar.",

    "There are Buddhists all over Nepal and hence Buddhist monuments are all over Nepal. In Kathmandu valley we have 2000 years old impressive stupa of Swoyambhunath and world's biggest stupa at Bouddhanath.The Bouddhanath stupa is 1500 years old and is more popular among the many Tibetan refugees living in Kathmandu .Inside the Kathmandu valley the city of Patan is dominantly Buddhists and has places like Mahabouddha Temple and Hiranya Varna Mahavihar to show you.On the outskirt of Kathmandu in the hill is the stupa of Namobuddha, small but old, active and highly revered"
