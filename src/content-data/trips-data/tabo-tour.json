  "para": [
    "Unlike most other monasteries in the Western Himalayas, Tabo stands on barren, flat ground and is built with mud brick. With breathtaking murals and stucco images, Tabo is often called 'The Ajanta of the Himalayas'. And here is the art that above all, is born of religion and deep faith.",
    "A small community of sixty monks resides here. The monastery has clay statues of the Buddha painted in the Kashmiri style."

This is via Narkanda, Rampur, Jeori, Wangtu, Karcham, Powari, Jangi, Puh, Khab, Chango and Hurling. Overnight stops enroute are possible. Upto Kullu by air or road. By road from Kullu to Tabo- 295 kms via Rohtang Pass, Gramphoo, Batal, Kunzam Pass and Kaza. Kaza is the headquarter of Spiti. It claims to have the highest gas filling station in the world.
